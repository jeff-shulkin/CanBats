// Define:
    Define BMS addresses
    Include LoRa library (already has addresses)
    Define SOP and EOP for LoRa transmission (??)

// Setup:
    Init LoRa
        Library handles all of this
    Init BMS
        - Boot
        - Establish current thresholds
        - Set our minimum capacity
    Establish that Node X is online
        - Maybe also say what longitude and latitude this is at?


// Tasks for our RTOS:
    LoRa Task (leaf node):
        Likely triggered by an interrupt (or super high priority?)
            - Pi tells Atmega there is log info
                - If atmega needs to MAKE log info, that's a separate Task
                - log info should be stored in an array of a Struct/class log
        Sends data until we get an EOP

    LoRa Task (central node):
        Triggered by Data0 interrupt (within LoRa Library)
        Receive data until we get an EOP
            - We need to define an EOP
    
    BMS Task:
        - Low priority
        - Samples Battery Q Val
        - If get to certain low power val:
            - Send over LoRa "Node X is low on battery"
            - Go to sleep
        - If we are sufficiently charged
            - Wake back up
